## Gatsby basics

- Gatsby is a framework to build modern websites.
- Gatsby websites are fast and that's because they are statically generated, meaning that at build time all the pages will be pre-rendered to HTML, JS and CSS. Other key features that make it fast are:
  - It only loads critical CSS for every page before it loads the content to prevent the jerky motion we see in some pages.
  - Rehydration: After serving the HTML, Gatsby will pick it up from there and turn it into a full fledged React app.
  - Lazy loads images, meaning it downloads the images when they are about to be seen, also compresses images and converts them to modern formats.
  - Huge plug-in ecosystem.
- By default Gatsby websites get great Lighthouse scores so they get great scores on: Performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.
- One of Gatsby's shortcomings is that due to it's static nature some things need to be coded in a particular way, specifically when it comes to dynamic pages.
